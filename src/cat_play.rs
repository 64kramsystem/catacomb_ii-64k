// Rust port: this routine seems to have had two bugs - one in the original, and the other in the SDL
// port.
//
// In the original, the [second warp assignment](https://github.com/64kramsystem/catacomb_ii-64k/blob/master/original_project/CAT_PLAY.C#L120)
// has a index of 2, while warp has (originally) a length of 2. It probably should have been 1.
//
// In the port, such assignment has been left to 2, and the warp size has been [increased to 3](https://github.com/64kramsystem/catacomb_ii-64k/blob/master/sdl_port_project/cat_play.c#L106),
// however, the assignment still doesn't make sense.
// Based on the history, the developer increased the array size by 1 because of a Clang warning, but
// didn't realize why the warning was raised.
//
// Interestingly, this a corrupting off-by-one error, and it was not easily detected because the atoi()
// API ignores trailing junk (ðŸ¤¦).
